//• User control of the curve’s order (k).
• User control of the parameter increment (u).
should 
//• Users should be able to add, move, and delete control points through mouse interaction.
//• Implement the efficient B-spline algorithm discussed in the lectures.
//• Use the standard knot sequence.
//• Include an option to demonstrate the algorithm in a geometric fashion.
• (Bonus 1, 20 marks) Extend your program to implement NURBS. This includes creating a
good interface for displaying and changing weights.
• (Bonus 2, 20 marks ) Extend your program to allow the user control of knot spacing and
multiple knots. This will mean showing the basis curves in parameter space as well as the
knot positions. In addition, an option to control sharp control points is required. For this
option, it is enough to use a multiple knot for the indicated control points.
• (Bonus 3, 20 marks) Extend your program to implement surfaces of revolution based on your
B-spline curves.

Keyboard controls:

	LEFT CLICK (on empty space)   - add control point 
	LEFT CLICK + HOLD (on point)  - select control point 
	LEFT CLICK + HOLD (on curve)  - select point on curve (geometric display)	  
	LEFT CLICK RELEASE            - deselect all points
	
	RIGHT CLICK	(on point)        - delete control point
	MOUSESCROLL	UP/DOWN           - increase/decrease curve order k
	-/+	                          - increase/decrease step increment
	RIGHT CLICK + DRAG LEFT/RIGHT - modify weight of selected NURBS point
	
	ESCAPE		- exit program
	
Bonus:  Nurbs implemented
